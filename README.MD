SmartMining v0.2.1

This mod add a mining ability.

To make use of the mining ability you must have at least a ship with the mining hullmod and a mining weapon.
The mining hullmod designates the ship as a mining ship and only ships with that hullmod are affected by events.
Mining weapons are the same as in Nexerelin. You can also check the settings.json

You can mine in asteroid fields, asteroid belts, rings, nebulas, coronas, pulsar beams


Planned features:
	- More mining missions
	- More hullmods
	- More events (like pirate attacks)
	- Differentiate locations better
```
